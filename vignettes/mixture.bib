abstract="Matrix-variate distributions represent a natural way for modeling random matrices. Realizations from random matrices are generated by the simultaneous observation of variables in different situations or locations, and are commonly arranged in three-way data structures. Among the matrix-variate distributions, the matrix normal density plays the same pivotal role as the multivariate normal distribution in the family of multivariate distributions. In this work we define and explore finite mixtures of matrix normals. An EM algorithm for the model estimation is developed and some useful properties are demonstrated. We finally show that the proposed mixture model can be a powerful tool for classifying three-way data both in supervised and unsupervised problems. A simulation study and some real examples are presented.",

abstract = "A novel model-based classification technique is introduced based on mixtures of multivariate t-distributions. A family of four mixture models is defined by constraining, or not, the covariance matrices and the degrees of freedom to be equal across mixture components. Parameters for each of the resulting four models are estimated using a multicycle expectation–conditional maximization algorithm, where convergence is determined using a criterion based on the Aitken acceleration. A straightforward, but very effective, technique for the initialization of the unknown component memberships is introduced and compared with a popular, more sophisticated, initialization procedure. This novel four-member family is applied to real and simulated data, where it gives good classification performance, even when compared with more established techniques."
